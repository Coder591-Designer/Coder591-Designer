I am a Coder that uses Python for custom projects that Pre-Existing Frameworks are really bad at.
I am currently working on a Web Framework Module called WebDev that uses common knowledge Python to create a better frame work that Flask or Django. In the end, however you can 
import certain functions or features from Django or Flask. There will also be a standard alternative to Django's DTL and <code>render()</code> function, in the form of 
DWDL, which stands for Dynamic Web Development Langugage. More exciting featues will soon be in the official docs.
